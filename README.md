- 👋 Hi, I’m @Cri5pyCarrot
- 👀 I’m interested increasing my knowledge in the tech and computer world...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python in my own time but formally enrolled in a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science degree at Aberystwyth University...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on... I'm not sure really. My experience so far is quite limited. I got into computer science because I built a rough point of sale system for my business back in South Africa that was loosely based on the resteraunt industry as the business dealt with a mix of long lasting products but mostly highly perishable flowers. I am now planning on using Arduinos to build a robot to automate the process of water management in a flower-agriculture setting.

- 😄 Pronouns: ... he/him
- ⚡ Fun facts: ... My favourite food is potatoes!
- Funny fact: I felt heroic after builidng my POS system and saw it being implemented in the business. After my first semester of computer science I went back to look at the code and couldn't help but laught because there was zero good practice in it... But that's a good sign, it means I've learned some stuff and have grown!
